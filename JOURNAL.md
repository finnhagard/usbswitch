## 10/25/2025 - Added Project Files  

So far I have just setup Git and all of my KiCad project files (still currently empty)

I hope to have this working in the next few days, this project should not be too difficult.

I created this project because it is really annoying having to unplug and replug my USB headset from my PS5 to my PC, so instead with this project I will be able to just plug my headset into the hub and then be able to switch with device it is 'plugged into' using a switch or button.
